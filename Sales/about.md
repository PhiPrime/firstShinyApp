About

This app was created to fulfil the requirements for the final project of
the [Developing Data Products course on
Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products).  
The app’s functionality is demonstrated with a demo dataset that was
obtained from a local reasturant. These data are the sales of various
items over the course of a year (04/25/18 - 04/25/19). The app allows
the user to input thier own csv file that has the following column names
with respective variables:  
\* **Name** - Name of the menu item  
\* **Quantity** - The amount sold within the Hour  
\* **Price** - The price of the item, used to calculate total sales per
hour.  
\* **Hour** - What hour the given row corresponds to as a numeral
(0-23), however decimals representing parts of the hour are also
acceptable (i.e. representing the time interval 10:08-10:22 as the 10.25
Hour)  
The app reads in the given dataset and generates a user interface to
toggle which item name(s) to display. The user can select whether
**Quantity** or **Total Sales** should be plotted on the y-axis (Total
Sales = Quantity\*Price).
